Want to find some free stuff? I've compiled a list of freebies that accumulated for almost a year now and there's no better way of sharing it than making it as a fully fledged website, of course.

Recently, I'm really getting enthustiastic about free and open software (or FOSS) and open content, in general. With some of the products are going competitive with the premium products such as [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/), I'm really thrilled looking into the future with these open content floating around. So why not bundle them up and compile them in a list. 

If you want to explore into the world of open content, here's a bit of a gateway for you. It's not complete compared to [other resource lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) but I tried to keep it small (saying while sitting at a count of 250 resources, lol).

## Contributing
Want to contribute? Feel free to do so. Not only you get to at least experience contributing to an open source project but it improves this project as well.

If you want to suggest some additional resources, you can file an issue here but I recommend it to file it [in the API repo of the site instead](https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/freebies-hunt-api) so that I can easily see it there.

If you want to contribute through code, just do the following:

- fork the repo
- clone the forked repo (`git clone <GIT_URL_OF_THE_FORKED_REPO>`)
- go to the project directory
- install the dependencies (`npm i`)
- open it in your local machine (`npm run develop`)

This is built with [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/) (and by extension, [React](http://reactjs.org/)) so at least familiarize yourself a bit with those things.

Also, this serves as a production use case for my [JSON database management system](https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/jayson-db) and it uses the [Freebies Hunt API](https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/freebies-hunt-api) which it's available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/freebies-hunt-api). So at least take a closer look at those to get a bigger picture on how the site is built. I'll put up a semi-detailed documentation on it soon but for now, [take a look on how the API was built](https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/freebies-hunt-api/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md).
